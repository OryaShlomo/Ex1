###Ex1
##This is my first github, which deal with the solution of Matala 1 (Ex1).
##This github is such a calculator of decimal number and number in all bases betwwen Binari and Hexa.
Actually, in this github you will find some function.
The "charToInt" function gets a "char" and return its decimal value as int. But it works only with the chars: '1', '2',...,'9', 'A', 'B', 'C',..,'G'.
The "inNumber" boolean function gets string as a number and returne "false" if the number isn't in the format, or "true" if the number is in the format.
The "number2Int" function gets string as a number and return its decimal value as int.
The "int2Number" function gets int param as a decimal number and also int param as a number of base (betwenn 2 and 16) and return a string as a number with the same value just in the base that it got.
The "add" fuction gets two number as a stirng and return the sum of both of them in decimal value (int).
The "mult" fuction gets two number as a stirng and return the product of both of them in decimal value and int.
The "maxIndex" function build an array with: two numbwer are in the format, the sum of them and the product of them, and return the index of the number with the biggest value.
